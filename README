STANDARD DISCLAIMER: Unlike most people who commit code to github, my primary motivation is simply to find a place for interesting code to live if I don't want to lose track of it. You'll find my coding styles vary from project to project and that I pay little attention to community standards or feedback. I do all that stuff at my day job. Enjoy!
